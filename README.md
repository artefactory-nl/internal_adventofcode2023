Welcome to Artefact's Advent of Code 2023! This is a unique opportunity for our engineering team to challenge themselves with daily programming puzzles throughout December. 

Each day, a new puzzle is unlocked - solve them at your own pace, learn new programming concepts, and improve your problem-solving skills!

To participate, first clone this repository using the command `git clone <repository_url>`. Then, create your personal branch with the format "name/solutions". 
For example, `git checkout -b mael/solutions`.

Upload your solutions in your branch the format "day_NUMBER.py". 
For example, for the first riddle of the first day, name your file as "day_1-1.py".
And enjoy the ride !
